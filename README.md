### Objective
- Phenology is described as the study of timing of different event such as flowering, leafing, and migrations
- The goal of our project is to develop essential biodiversity variables using Google Earth and extract and analyze phenological metrics to explore trends over time time using two key packages `RGEE` and `GreenBrown`. 
- The metrics we are extracting follows
    1. Start of season (SOS)
    2. End of season (EOS), 
    3. Point of peak value (POP)
    4. Length of season(LOS)
