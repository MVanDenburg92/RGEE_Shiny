# Phenology with GEE and R


### Objective
- Phenology is described as the study of timing of different event such as flowering, leafing, and migrations
- The goal of our project is to develop essential biodiversity variables using Google Earth Engine to extract and analyze phenological metrics to explore trends over  time using two key packages `RGEE` and `GreenBrown`. 
- The metrics we are extracting follows
    1. Start of season (SOS)
    2. End of season (EOS), 
    3. Point of peak value (POP)
    4. Length of season(LOS)

## Product Updates 

### Fall 2020 Product
Following our work from this semester, we are able to extract these metrics for over 7 years from 2000-2007 using only EVI and one site and visualize it on a shiny app which is hosted online on github for people to download and utilize. 


### Spring 2020 End Product: 
Google Earth Engine App that allows the user to select an input region and extract these metrics based on user input:
Imagery Collection
Dates
Desired Metric
